# Lane-detection-for-autonomous-vehicles


This project implements a lane detection system for autonomous vehicles using computer vision techniques. It takes video as input data, process it and highlight lane markings, aiding in lane-keeping for autonomous driving.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main components:
1. **Lane Detection**: Processes video frames to detect and visualize lane markings.
2. **Image Preprocessing and PSNR Calculation**: Handles image preprocessing and evaluates the quality of image reconstruction using PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio).

## Libraries 

libraries Used:-

- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `Pillow`
- `tensorflow`
